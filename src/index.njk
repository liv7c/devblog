          Hi, I’m Olivia, a self-taught <strong>front-end developer</strong>. 
          I love sharing what I learn, from testing and developer tools to HTML and command-line workflows.

    <h2>A few (not that interesting) facts about me</h2>
    <ul class="home-facts-list">
      <li>
        I wrote my first line of code at 23 and never looked back. I instantly fell in love with building UIs, and it's been my passion for the past six years as a front-end developer.
      </li>
      <li>
        My first ever project was a WordPress website I built for my dad's bookshop. It was the ultimate introduction to learning how to solve problems one step at a time. The website is still live and working! It holds a special place in my heart.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started coding React projects when classes were still a thing and hooks didn't exist...
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>
          Outside of front-end development, I’ve been exploring the Go language. My first Go project was a <a href="https://github.com/liv7c/gen_prettier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">little command-line tool to generate prettier files</a>.
