          Hi, I’m Olivia, a self-taught front-end developer. 
          I love sharing my learnings, from developer tools to web accessibility and performance.

    <h2>A few (not that interesting) facts about me</h2>
    <ul class="home-facts-list">
      <li>
        I wrote my first line of code at 24 and never looked back. I instantly fell in love with building UIs, and it's been my passion for the past 6 years as a front-end developer.
      </li>
      <li>
        My first ever project was a Wordpress website I built for my dad's bookshop. It was the ultimate introduction to learning how to solve problems one step at a time. The website is still in production and working! It holds a special place in my heart.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started coding React projects when classes were still a thing and hooks did not exist...
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ve been trying to finish The Voyage Out by Virginia Woolf for the past 6 months... It's such a great book, but I keep having to restart it. (Am I in an infinite loop?)
