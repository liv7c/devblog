      <li>
        I’ve been working as a front-end developer for the past six years, building products for both B2C and B2B.
      </li>
      <li>My journey into coding started with a year and a half of self-learning. This time was filled with perseverance, frustration, and plenty of "What am I doing?" moments.</li>
      <li>Professionally, I’ve worked extensively with React and its evolving ecosystem, from (vanilla) Redux and class components to migrating codebases to hooks and TypeScript.</li>
      <li>Web accessibility is something I care deeply about. With every project, I try to dig deeper and build things that are as inclusive and user-friendly as possible.</li>
      <li>I also love branching out and experimenting. Lately, that means learning Go to build small tools that improve my dev workflow. And for the past three years, I’ve been using Vim (still a basic user, but editing this way makes me happy).</li>

          <p><strong>Since June 2023</strong>, I’ve been working as a senior front-end developer at <a href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en" target="_blank">Welcome to the Jungle</a>. My core contributions include leading the front-end development for new B2C products, such as an application tracker for candidates. In the past year, I’ve been working on building a new product from the ground up.</p>

          <h3>Front-end Developer - Meilleurs Agents</h3>
          <p><strong>From October 2018 to December 2022</strong>, I worked as a Front-End Developer at <a href="https://www.meilleursagents.com/" target="_blank">Meilleurs Agents</a>, where I contributed to building new products and improving existing ones. I had the opportunity to integrate a fresh layout for the B2B application, implement a state machine using XState for a product that’s now live, and migrate tests from Enzyme to React Testing Library. In addition to these technical tasks, I also mentored team members. </p>
